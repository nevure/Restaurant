## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. 
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

It's recommended to have an editor installed that supports Spring and has an application server incorporated. 
Otherwise, you can manually install the application server and follow the instructions for running the program locally. 

Skip this section's steps if you already have git  installed your local machine, and a valid GitHub account.
If not, follow next steps:

 > 1. Download and install git CLI if you haven't yet: https://git-scm.com/
 > 2. Create a GitHub account if you haven't yet: https://github.com/
>     Then check for its version, to make sure the installation went fine.
>     To do so, type this in your terminal or console:

```
git--version
```

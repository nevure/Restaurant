## WORKING WITH BRANCHES

This project has 2 branches (main and Dev), which should NOT be manipulated by any developer.
That role is restricted to project managers, who will accept or reject developer's pull requests.
Use the following semantics for naming your branches: <ScrumTask_ID> or optionally <ScrumTask_ID-featureBranchName>.
For example: B1 or B1.4_UserController

And don't forget to create your feature branches from Dev.
To do so:
>1. Pull actual Dev branch state:
	git pull origin Dev
>2. Create your feature branch:
	git checkout -b <featureBranchName>
>3. Work on your branch. Do your add-to-stage and commits
>4. Pull Dev branch state again:
	git pull origin Dev
>5. Push your branch to the repo:
	git push origin <featureBranchName>
>6. Finally, do a pull request in GitHub, from your branch to Dev
